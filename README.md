5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google Learn Guide

Welcome to our 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google! This was a live event from November 11-15, 2024, now made available as a self-paced learning guide for anyone interested in learning more about the fundamental technologies and techniques behind Generative AI.

What's covered:
Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering - Explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Get trained with the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.
Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases - Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoffs.
Day 3: Generative AI Agents - Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.
Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs - Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.
Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI - Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.
Best of Luck!
